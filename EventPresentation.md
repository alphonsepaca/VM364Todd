Indie Developers utilize show floor to showcase games that otherwise may not have opportunities to generate the fire needed to fully fund a game.

The Developers behind "We Happy Few" took advantage of the Pax East showroom floor with their demo by allowing players to test the game with a chance to win a prize. The usage of a prize made playing the game that much more attractive as the prize was an Alpha Key to help playtest the game in the future. By doing this, the developers gain real world playtesters and they generate an air of exclusivity through the fact that the only people who receive Alpha keys are those who both _locate_ and _Beat_ the scenarios that have been laid out before players sit down to play the game.
